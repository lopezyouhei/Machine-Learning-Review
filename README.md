# Change!
I will remove this section once I start to add files related to projects in this repo. 

# Aim
Keep track of mini and large projects regarding the topic of machine learning in one repository (this will probably consist of several links attached to this repository).

# Machine-Learning-Review
This repository will hold a culmination of different repositories which all have the main theme of machine learning. It will include documentation on projects I do while learning from a course or book, personal projects, and hopefully collaboration projects for recreational and professional use!
